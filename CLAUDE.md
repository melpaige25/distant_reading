# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the `distant_reading` repository - currently in initial setup phase.

The name "distant reading" typically refers to a computational approach to literary analysis that uses quantitative methods to analyze large text corpora, as opposed to traditional "close reading" of individual texts.

## Current State

This is a new repository with minimal structure. As the project develops, this file should be updated with:

- Build and test commands
- Architecture and code structure
- Key dependencies and their purposes
- Development workflow and conventions
- Any project-specific patterns or requirements

## Development Setup

(To be added once project structure is established)
